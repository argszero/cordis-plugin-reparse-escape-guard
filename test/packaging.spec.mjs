/**
 * Packaging guard: the published artifact must declare every bare specifier it
 * imports, and must not declare packages it never imports.
 *
 * Both directions have bitten these plugins before (the same guard runs in
 * `cordis-plugin-tool-deadline-guard`, `session-trigger`, `search-budget` and
 * `credential-rotate`):
 *
 * - A value import left in `peerDependencies`-only (or, worse,
 *   `devDependencies`-only) resolves fine on the publishing machine — the
 *   workspace is right there — and fails for a consumer with
 *   `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. `npm i <name>` in an empty directory is the only
 *   shape that catches it, and it only catches it after the release.
 * - A dependency kept after the import is gone is invisible until someone audits
 *   the tarball, and it silently widens the install closure.
 *
 * So the guard asserts an equivalence, not a one-way rule: the set of bare
 * specifiers reached by `src/**\/*.ts` and `lib/**\/*.js` equals the set of
 * runtime-declared packages (`dependencies` ∪ `peerDependencies`). A missing
 * declaration and a stale declaration both fail.
 *
 * This package has one type-only import that is nonetheless a real requirement:
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-policy` supplies the `sandboxPolicy` service the
 * guard reads, so it belongs in `peerDependencies` even though nothing survives
 * into `lib/`. That is a declaration of a runtime need, not an artifact of the
 * scan — hence a peer rather than a dependency.
 *
 * `node:test` walks the same directory as the behaviour suite, so `npm test`
 * cannot pass without it — and the build runs first, so `lib/` is present.
